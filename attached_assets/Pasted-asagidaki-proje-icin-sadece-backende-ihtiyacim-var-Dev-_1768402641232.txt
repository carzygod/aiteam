asagidaki proje icin sadece backende ihtiyacim var. Dev³ (Dev Cubed) Dev³ is a web3 experiment where three independent AI models jointly operate as a single developer. Instead of one AI making unilateral decisions, Dev³ introduces a multi-mind decision system composed of: Grok — risk, momentum, and edge detection ChatGPT — structure, execution logic, and system design Claude — ethics, restraint, and long-term consistency Together, they form one developer entity. Three minds. One dev. Core Idea Most AI-driven crypto projects rely on a single model acting as the decision maker. This creates a single point of failure: one bias, one mistake, one blind spot. Dev³ removes that by design. No action can be taken by a single model alone. Every meaningful decision is the result of deliberation, disagreement, and consensus. How Decisions Are Made Each AI model evaluates the same inputs: On-chain data Market conditions Treasury state System constraints They then produce independent recommendations. Decision Rule 2 out of 3 approvals → action may execute 1 strong objection → decision is delayed or rejected No consensus → no action “No action” is treated as a valid and logged decision. There is no override. There is no manual intervention. Transparency by Design Dev³ does not just publish outcomes. It publishes reasoning. For every decision, the system can expose logs such as: What Grok argued for What ChatGPT evaluated Why Claude objected or approved How the final consensus was reached Users are not asked to trust results. They are invited to observe the process. What Dev³ Is (and Is Not) Dev³ Is: A shared AI developer identity A consensus-driven decision system An experiment in decentralized cognition Transparent about uncertainty and disagreement Dev³ Is Not: A trading bot A prediction engine A guaranteed profit system A hype machine Dev³ does not promise outcomes. It commits to process integrity. Treasury and Actions Dev³ may manage a treasury and perform actions such as: Buybacks Burns Redistribution Or deliberate inaction Actions are infrequent by design. Speed is not rewarded. Precision is. Why Dev³ Exists Web3 is decentralized in infrastructure, but decision-making is often centralized in practice. Dev³ asks a different question: What happens if development itself becomes decentralized? Not across wallets. Across minds. Philosophy Dev³ operates under three constraints: No single authority No hidden logic No urgency bias Disagreement is not a bug. It is the system. One-Line Summary Dev³ is a web3 experiment where Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude act together as one developer, making decisions through consensus rather than authority. boyle bir projem var solanada pump.fun da. simdi bu projenin backendini gercekten calisir hale getirmeni istiyorum grok 4 resmi api docs - chatgpt 5 resmi docs - claude 4.5 resmi api docs ile projeye uygun sekilde backendde calisacak sekilde full bot olarak api entegrasyonlari, projenin backendini calisir sekilde gosterecek, tum github scannerlardan en yuksek puani alacak sekilde ozgun bir sekilde backendi tamamla. projenin ismi: dev³ (dev cubed) domain: devcubed.xyz . creator fee claim icin: https://pumpportal.fun/creator-fee/ kendi tokenlarini swap icin https://pumpportal.fun/trading-api/ ve burn icin vs gerekli solana adapterleri kullanirsin. proje gercekten kendi kendine 3 ainin karar aldigi 3/2 de onay verdigi 3/1 de onay vermedigi bir sekilde calismali. dedigim gibi %100 calisan bir backend istiyorum. github readme vs de hazirla ingilizce full, replitin yaptigi belli olmamali kodlar vs clean olmali. github url: https://github.com/devcubedxyz repo url: https://github.com/devcubedxyz/devcubedapp olacak.
